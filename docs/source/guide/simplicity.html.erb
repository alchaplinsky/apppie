  <h1>Simplicity</h1>
  <h2>Keep it as simple as possible simple</h2>
   <p>UI elements should be designed to include the minimum footprint of an element.  Try to avoid lots of nested elements or wrapper elements that are needed only for styling.  If extra styling is needed, consider using pseudo selectors :after and :before.</p>

   <h2>Avoid fixed sizes</h2>
   <p>No fixed width, width of an element should be defined by parent. No fixed height, height of the element should be defined by content.</p>
