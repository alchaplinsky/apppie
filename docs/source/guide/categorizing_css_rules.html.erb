  <h1>Categorizing CSS Rules</h1>
  <p>Every project needs some organization. Throwing every new style you create onto the end of a single file would make finding things more difficult and would be very confusing for anybody else working on the project. It is important to have a standard high-level structure in place.</p>

  <p>In our case categories would be:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Base rules</li>
    <li>Layout</li>
    <li>Typography</li>
    <li><a href="objects.html">Objects</a></li>
    <li><a href="modules.html">Modules</a></li>
    <li>Sections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Base rules are the defaults. They are foundation which is used in every product. Most likely they will stay unchanged while being moved from one product to another.</p>
  
  <p>Base rules include reset syles, grids, spaces and utilities(helpers) classes.</p>

  <p>Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.</p>

  <p>Typography rules define basic text styling. All types of headers that are used in project, text and link styles, fonts and colors are defined here.</p>
