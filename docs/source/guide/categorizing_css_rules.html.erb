  <h1>Categorizing CSS Rules</h1>
  <p>Every project needs some organization. Throwing every new style you create onto the end of a single file would make finding things more difficult and would be very confusing for anybody else working on the project. Of course, you likely have some organization in place already.</p>

  <p>There are four types of categories:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Base Styles</li>
    <li>Layout</li>
    <li>Typography</li>
    <li>Modules</li>
    <li>Sections</li>
  </ul>
  <p>Base rules are the defaults. Reset.css, grids, spaces and util classes, that stays the same across all the projects.</p>

  <p>Layout rules divide the page into sections. Layouts hold one or more modules together.</p>

  <p>Typography rules define basic text styling. All types of headers that are used in project, text and link styles, fonts and colors are defined here.</p>

  <p>Modules are the reusable, modular parts of our design. They are the ui elements, buttons, inputs, lists, blocks and more complex modules.</p>
