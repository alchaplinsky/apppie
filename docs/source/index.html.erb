      <h2>Why is anything needed here?</h2>
      <p>Working on product alone allows you to deal with your demons yourself. Pair? Pretty easy with few conventions. Team? This is where all the zoo breaks out.</p>
      <p>I bet you saw (or can imagine) what happens with CSS code when product accross the year was being maintained by several front end engineers who did not have any conventions. Mess and selectors longer than life.</p>
      <p>So that is what we try to battle by having reasonable rules based on some experience and practice got in combat.</p>
